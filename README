pyrib is a wrapper around the Renderman library.

It currently supports 3Delight, but support for PRman and other Renderman compatible renderers should be easy to add.

It is currently in a *very* early stage.  Essentially the only functions implemented yet are the ones using only basic data types such as RtFloat, RtInt and RtToken.

RiSphere and RiDisplay are hacked up so that the sample application can display something.
